# SwiftGraylog

Graylog library written in Swift.

## Documentation

First you have to define your Graylog server URL:

```swift
if let url = URL(string: "https://yourgraylog.com/gelf") {
    Graylog.setURL(url)
}
```

Then you can send log to Graylog using the `log` method by passing a dictionary which represents your JSON payload:

```swift
Graylog.log(["message": "Hello Graylog!"])
```

Here is a list of available fields in Graylog: [Graylog Documentation](http://docs.graylog.org/en/2.4/pages/gelf.html)

If an issue is thrown while sending a log, a message will be printed in the Xcode console. The framework stores logs locally in the user preferences and retry the failed one each 60 seconds.

## Installation

### Cocoapods

Add the dependency to your Podfile:

```
pod 'SwiftGraylog'
```

and use `import SwiftGraylog` where you want to use it.
